"""
Control your mouse cursor with your tobii eye tracker. This is an alternative to the default "Eye Tracking > Control Mouse" method.

It shows a dim circle (that looks kind of like a lens) wherever you look, instead of always moving the mouse cursor where you look. Only when you "click" does it move the mouse cursor to where the circle is, and do a mouse click. I found having the mouse cursor always moving to be distracting, and so prefer this mode.

By default, pressing F3 does the click. I did it this way because I use a separate noise recognition tool to make my clicking sound. You may want to map the click() method in this file to the "pop" sound (see https://github.com/dwiel/talon_community/blob/master/noise/pop.py)
